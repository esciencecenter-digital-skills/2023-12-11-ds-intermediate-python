## 🏢 Location logistics
* Coffee and toilets are in the hallway, just outside of the classroom.
* If you leave the building, 
  be sure to be accompanied by someone from the escience center to let you back in through the groundfloor door
* For access to this floor you might need to ring the doorbell so someone can let you in
* In case of an emergency, you can exit our floor using the main staircase.
  Or follow green light signs at the ceiling to the emergency staircase.
* **Wifi**: Eduroam should work. Otherwise use the 'matrixbuilding' network, password should be printed out and available somewhere in the room.

## 🎓 Certificate of attendance
If you attend the full workshop you can request a certificate of attendance by emailing to training@esciencecenter.nl .



## 🔧 Exercises

### Section 5 
#### Project links ('Decide on your groups repository'): 
- Cecile - https://github.com/Cecilevdstappen/python-intermediate-inflammation (Erasms MC team already working on it)
- Erasmus MC - https://github.com/RCvanOosterhoudt/inflammation in develop (comment: this is a fork from a different repository, and no issues can be raised here)
    - I think on forks, issues are not enabled by default, but they can be enabled by the owner of the repository: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16406180/is-there-a-way-to-add-issues-to-a-github-forked-repo-without-modifying-the-orig
- Shuxin Zhang and Pascal de Koster - https://github.com/sxzhang1201/python-intermediate-inflammation-review/

#### (1) Issues
In your own project, examine your code for possible improvements and create issues for it.

#### (2) Dependencies
Among the dependencies in your own project, assess one or two based on what you learned in this section (and in the rest of the workshop). Would you choose the same dependency again? Or would you choose alternatives, and if so, which ones?

### Section 6: Apply to own project(s)
Try to apply what you learned to your own project(s). This is the time to ask any questions to our instructors or let us help you solve problems that you run into.
- If you want you can discuss how to best use the remaining time with one of the instructors
- If your project is not on a cloud-based Git repo (such as GitHub) now is the time to do so!
- Go through the material and create GitHub issues for each improvement you want to make for your project. 
- If there are any big architectural changes it can help to first make a good design and discuss it with your neighbour or one of the instructors.
- Solve the issues one by one

## 🧠 Collaborative Notes
### 💬 Feedback **MORNING** Day 3
Can you give us some feedback about the course so far?
Please write down one thing that went well and one thing that can be improved:
Think about the pace, the instructors, the content, the interaction, the coffee, location. Any feedback is welcome!

#### What went well?
- I really have enjoyed the course. Enthusiastic and firendly instructors. The material has been very extensive and I have been exposed to alot of new things while learning also useful things that I can apply in my research projects.
- a lot of helps from teachers and colleagus
- Teachers had enough time for everyone. Course material is extensive with an example for almost everything. Nice that there is also some time to apply the material to your own work.
- Having a soft agenda and vague (in a positive sense) exercises really stimulated collaboration and discussion within the group; this is quite unique when comparing it to other workshop formats (such as the coderefinery) 
- It was a very valuable experience to apply all practices to my own code. I could apply the parts that I thought were interesting and useful, and was therefore fully tailored to my needs. The support from the teachers was excellent.

#### What can be improved?
- Sometimes it was a lot of reading. 
- It would also be nice to elaborate on when you use objective/functional oriented programming.
- Even more personal examples of any of the mentioned concepts
- The material was too broad. From object orientation, to software development life cycle, and then back to planning with GitHub. Perhaps separate them more in a number of courses?
- The morning session of doday (part 5, day 3) felt unnecessary to me, and I don't think I leared much from it.
