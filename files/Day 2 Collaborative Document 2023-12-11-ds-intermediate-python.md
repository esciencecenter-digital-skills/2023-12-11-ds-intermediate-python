## üè¢ Location logistics
* Coffee and toilets are in the hallway, just outside of the classroom.
* If you leave the building, 
  be sure to be accompanied by someone from the escience center to let you back in through the groundfloor door
* For access to this floor you might need to ring the doorbell so someone can let you in
* In case of an emergency, you can exit our floor using the main staircase.
  Or follow green light signs at the ceiling to the emergency staircase.
* **Wifi**: Eduroam should work. Otherwise use the 'matrixbuilding' network, password should be printed out and available somewhere in the room.

## üéì Certificate of attendance
If you attend the full workshop you can request a certificate of attendance by emailing to training@esciencecenter.nl .

## üîß Optional exercises
#### Default optional exercise: apply to own project(s)
Try to apply what you learned to your own project(s). This is the time to ask any questions to our instructors or let us help you solve problems that you run into.

### Section 3
#### Persistence
Now that we‚Äôve covered the basics of different programming paradigms and how we can integrate them into our multi-layer architecture, there are two optional extra episodes which you may find interesting.

Both episodes cover the persistence layer of software architectures and methods of persistently storing data, but take different approaches. The episode on [persistence with JSON](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/persistence/) covers some more advanced concepts in Object Oriented Programming, while the [episode on databases](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/databases) starts to build towards a true multilayer architecture, which would allow our software to handle much larger quantities of data.

### Section 4

#### GitHub collaboration
- As you've now seen, Pull Requests are a helpful way to keep new features separate until they've been reviewed. To force this behavior, even for yourself, you can [**protect**](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule#creating-a-branch-protection-rule) a branch in GitHub. Try this for yourself, and see what happens if you still commit to main locally and try to push it. How would you fix this when it happens?

#### Packaging
- Have a look at the [Python Packaging Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/)
- Try actually publishing your code to [test.pypi.org](https://test.pypi.org) based on the above guide

### üí¨ Feedback **MORNING** Day 2
Can you give us some feedback about the course so far?
Please write down one thing that went well and one thing that can be improved:
Think about the pace, the instructors, the content, the interaction, the coffee, location. Any feedback is welcome!

#### What went well?
- great to see personal examples
-
-
-
-All clear and people help a lot
PLEASE ADD TO FEEDBACK AFTERNOON

#### What can be improved?
- Perhaps mention the GUI tools for Git like source tree and GitHub desktopclient: https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ and https://desktop.github.com/ or the use of IDE Git support?
- For getting easier through a few pages, for example 'Object Oriented Programming page'; it would be nice to have a few of the examples shortly by presented at beginning or during the working moments
- Many sections have some links to additional reading material for extra information which is great, but some other sections don't where it can be helpful to have, such as the decorators section.
PLEASE ADD TO FEEDBACK AFTERNOON

### End of day announcements:
- Quick poll for program tomorrow
- Tomorrow we will have drinks!
- Please fill in feedback

### üí¨ Feedback **AFTERNOON** Day 2
Can you give us some feedback about the course so far?
Please write down one thing that went well and one thing that can be improved:
Think about the pace, the instructors, the content, the interaction, the coffee, location. Any feedback is welcome!

#### What went well?
- Really good that you motivate people to get a break.
- Readable and organized documents
- The collaboration part was nice, since it really helped to look together at an exercise.
- Team exercise was nice, always good to learn from each other instead of tackling it alone.
- I like that there is endless things to explore that are optional and the necessary things to keep participating in the workshop are kept relatively short.

#### What can be improved?
- It was a lot of information, and in particular the last few about packaging and distributing were not that interesting for me, and I was not able to absorb this anymore.

        all_distinct([N1,N2,N3,N4,N5,N6,N7,N8,N9]),
        blocks(Ns1, Ns2, Ns3).
```

#### Using logic programming in Python
Note that we needs some lines to define the constraints of the problem,
but that actually solving the soduko is only one line of code: `solution = problem.getSolution()`.
Based on the defined constraints the constraint library can deduct the only correct solution.

```python
from constraint import Problem

def solve_sudoku(board):
    # Create a constraint satisfaction problem
    problem = Problem()

    # Add variables and their domains
    for i in range(9):
        for j in range(9):
            if board[i][j] == 0:
                # If the cell is empty, add a variable with domain [1, 9]
                problem.addVariable((i, j), range(1, 10))
            else:
                # If the cell is already filled, add a fixed value constraint
                problem.addVariable((i, j), [board[i][j]])

    # Add constraints for rows, columns, and sub-grids
    for i in range(9):
        problem.addConstraint(
            lambda a, b: a != b, [(i, j) for j in range(9)])  # Row constraints
        problem.addConstraint(
            lambda a, b: a != b, [(j, i) for j in range(9)])  # Column constraints

    for i in range(0, 9, 3):
        for j in range(0, 9, 3):
            problem.addConstraint(
                lambda a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i: len(
                    set([a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i])) == 9,
                [(i + x, j + y) for x in range(3) for y in range(3)])  # Sub-grid constraints

    # Solve the problem
    solution = problem.getSolution()

    if solution is None:
        return None

    # Convert the solution to a 2D list
    solved_board = [[solution[(i, j)] for j in range(9)] for i in range(9)]
    return solved_board

# Example usage
board = [
    [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
    [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
    [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
    [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]
]

solution = solve_sudoku(board)
if solution is not None:
    print("Solved Sudoku:")
    for row in solution:
        print(row)
else:
    print("No solution exists.")
