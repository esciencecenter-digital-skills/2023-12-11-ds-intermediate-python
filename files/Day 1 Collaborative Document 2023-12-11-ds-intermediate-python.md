## 🏢 Location logistics
* Coffee and toilets are in the hallway, just outside of the classroom.
* If you leave the building, 
  be sure to be accompanied by someone from the escience center to let you back in through the groundfloor door
* For access to this floor you might need to ring the doorbell so someone can let you in
* In case of an emergency, you can exit our floor using the main staircase.
  Or follow green light signs at the ceiling to the emergency staircase.
* **Wifi**: Eduroam should work. Otherwise use the 'matrixbuilding' network, password should be printed out and available somewhere in the room.

## 🎓 Certificate of attendance
If you attend the full workshop you can request a certificate of attendance by emailing to training@esciencecenter.nl .

## 🔧 Optional Exercises
#### Default optional exercise: apply to own project(s)
Try to apply what you learned to your own project(s). This is the time to ask any questions to our instructors or let us help you solve problems that you run into.

### Section 1
1. Install different IDEs and test them out. Which one do you like the most?
2. Upgrade your command line! Checkout [`z`](https://github.com/rupa/z) and [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
3. Try out `conda` as a virtual environment manager for Python. What are the main differences? Do you like it better than `venv`?
4. You decide to change the max line length of your project to 100 instead of the default 80. Find out how you can configure `pylint`. You can first try to use the `pylint` command line interface, but also play with adding a configuration file that `pylint` reads in.

### Section 2

- For your test coverage, have a look at the concept of [branch coverage](https://about.codecov.io/blog/line-or-branch-coverage-which-type-is-right-for-you/) as opposed to just line coverage. Which do you prefer and why?
- Look at some [projects](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) [on](https://github.com/pyjokes/pyjokes) [GitHub](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) and see how much test coverage they have. Should 100% line (or branch) coverage always be the goal? Why or why not?
- Add build and test coverage badges to your repository's README
- Manually parameterizing your tests is hard! There's always the chance of missing an edge case. Read up on property-based testing using the [hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package. Would this be useful for your project(s)?

### 💬 Feedback Morning Day 1
Can you give us some feedback about the course so far?
Please write down one thing that went well and one thing that can be improved:
Think about the pace, the instructors, the content, the interaction, the coffee, location. Any feedback is welcome!

#### What went well?
- The combing of a bit of lecture and also hands-on work
- The introducting lecture-style at the start is nice to create a kind of framework/base to link the exercises to.
- instructions for location improved since the last time I was here (6 months ago). Sign on the door etc is helpful
- Carpentry explanations are okay, but too much for the time available.
- The direct implementation of what you learn helps a lot!
- Very clear instruction set also forseeing potential issues and giving advice already how to sovle them
- checking in with everyone once in a while makes it very interactive
- all helpers help a lot and explain very well
- starting from a short introduction and followed by the prectice is really nice
- Very nice tips from instructors with experience and knowledge on a broad range of subjects
- Very good learning experience


PLEASE WRITE YOUR FEEDBACK A BIT DOWN IN THE PART FOR THE AFTERNOON
THANK YOU :):

#### What can be improved?
- PyCharm version was not up-to-date with the course.
- SSH-connection was not working (HTTPS did though).
- Too much of a reading ...
- There are too much side ways ...
- too much reading
- would be nice if there is a detailed manual for VS code :+1::+1: 
- Bit too little time for section 2
-
-
- Like you said in the beginning, it might be a bit too much reading; so I would suggest to interrupt once in a while for a 5 min presentation
- give specific time per topic and check all together some exercices e.g. 20 min topic 2

#### Sven's summary:
- Too much reading .... We can not do anything about the material now. Make use of our personal explanation service!
- Screenshots of Pycharm and GitHub are always outdated... Choose your dependencies wisely!

### End-of-the-day announcements 
- Take a sandwich home (see kitchen, also in the fridge with the see-through door)
- Quick poll: tomorrow morning start with section 3 (maybe finish or almost finish section 2 at home), or another hour for section 2?
- Tomorrow 9:30 start, you are welcome from 9:00
- Why did GitHub network show a straight line instead of a fork? See StackOverflow in the resources.

### 💬 Feedback Afternoon Day 1
#### What went well?
- Good support of the instructors!
- Nice to work at own pace
- Nice that you can work on your own pace and useful exercises with good examples
- great that you stimulate breaks! :+1:
- Good work with the optional task. 
- The supervisors have great background knowledge

#### What can be improved?
- Would be nice to point out where you could find why the testing fails, for example when there is an error in the main.yml file.
-
- There are too many topics for one day to explore this all for 100%. Further the carpentry contains not so modern GUI examples and tool versions.
-
-


#### Guide for keeping up to speed with the group:
- If you are still halfway section 1, you can skim through [code style conventions](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/15-coding-conventions/index.html)
- this can be skipped in section 2: https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/24-diagnosing-issues-improving-robustness/index.html
